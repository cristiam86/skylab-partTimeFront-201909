Object
Tasks
isObject
Write a JavaScript function to check whether an input is an object or not.

Create object car
Write an object that represents a car with three properties: brand, model, color. Add a method that shows the following message: 'My black Seat LeÃ³n is great!' (Hint: use this)

Use literal notation, and object constructor notation.

Stack
Create an object that manages a data structure following the stack principles FILO (first in last out) which means, the first object to be inserted should be the last to be pulled out.

The object should have its constructor new Stack() and the following methods:

insertElement(element): inserts an element into the stack
getElement(): retrieves the corresponding element from the stack
print(): prints the stack as comma-separated string elements
Queue




Create an object that manages a data structure following the queue principles FIFO (first in first out) which means, the first object to be inserted should be the first to be pulled out.

The object should have its constructor new Queue() and the following methods:

insertElement(element): inserts an element into the queue
getElement(): retrieves the corresponding element from the queue
print(): prints the queue as comma-separated string elements





Linked List
Create an object that manages a data structure following the linked list principles. A Linked List allows to insert an element in any given position as well as retrieve an element from any position. The elements should be objects and not primitive variables. Its structure should follow the following pattern:

var node = {
    prevElement,
    data
}
The object should have its constructor new LinkedList() and the following methods:

insertElement(element, index): inserts an element into the list at the position index
getElement(index): retrieves the corresponding element at position index
print(): prints the data property of each list node as comma-separated string elements


The blockchain
From Wikipedia: a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).

That cryptographic hash of the previous block validates the entire chain and ensures that if any value on any block changes, all the subsequent blocks must change their hash in order to keep the chain valid.

Create the block object function constructor new Block(...) with the following attributes:

number: length of the chain where this block is located
timestamp: timestamp of the block creation
prevHash: hash of the previous block (the first node should have an empty string)
data: any string, number, object or array
Create the blockchain object function constructor new BlockChain() with the following attributes and methods

blocks: array with the blocks added to the chain
addBlock: creates a new block and adds it to the chain
isValidChain: checks if every hash refference of each block is correct
HINT: hashfunction:

var hash = function(s) {
    var a = 1, c = 0, h, o;
    if (s) {
        a = 0;
        for (h = s.length - 1; h >= 0; h--) {
            o = s.charCodeAt(h);
            a = (a<<6&268435455) + o + (o<<14);
            c = a & 266338304;
            a = c!==0?a^c>>21:a;
        }
    }
    return String(a);
};
